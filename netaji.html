      <h1><u>What a great motivation Netaji is !!</u></h1>
      <p>Netaji infused courage and confidence in the hearts of freedom fighters. His army, named as Indian National Army (INA), was a startling example of Netaji’s superior warcraft and able leadership qualities. Some of his inspiring quotes he delivered to motivate the INA men in particular and the Indian citizens in general can throw more light on Netaji’s patriotism and sacrifice.</p>
      <p>"One individual may die for an idea, but that idea will, after his death, incarnate itself in a thousand lives.""It is blood alone that can pay the price of freedom. Give me blood and I will give you freedom".</p>
      <h2><u>Freedom Fighter</u></h2>
      <p>Netaji was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule. He founded the Forward Bloc in 1939 and later formed the Indian National Army to fight against the British during World War II. He was imprisoned by the British several times and went on hunger strikes to protest against the British rule.</p>
      <h2><u>Death</u></h2>
      <p>Netaji died on August 18, 1945 in a plane crash in Taipei, Taiwan. However, there are many conspiracy theories surrounding his death and some believe that he actually survived and went into hiding.</p>
